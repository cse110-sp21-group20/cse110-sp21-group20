#### Decisions Made
> 1. After doing a poll on the name of the group, "WeCommitToMaster" was picked as the name with the majority of votes.
> 2. For the intro video, it was decided that every member should record a 15-second video, introducing themselves. Vanessa Chen volunteered to put individual videos together and create a single video for the group.
> 3. With the majority of votes, green was picked as the color for representing the group. As discussed before in Slack, since green is known for reducing stress and anxiety, we thought that it would be a good color to show our passion for reducing daily stress by creating a good journaling app.
> 4. For the logo, we decided that a journal surrounded by 8 stars, each star representing each member of the group, would be a good candidate.
> 5. For group roles, we decided that it would be good for everyone to share with the rest of the group what they are comfortable doing. Some people suggested that they would like to be involved in multiple aspects of the project. We decided to create a Google doc shared with everyone, where people can describe what they would like to do. Also, we decided that it would be good for everyone to share what they feel about their role during weekly meetings so that if they would like to switch roles, they can do so. Additionally, we decided that we need to have multiple people observe the work of others in order to increase the bus factor.
