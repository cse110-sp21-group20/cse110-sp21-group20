#### Decisions Made/Summary

> * The team has ranked pretty high on all aspects defined including testing practices, communication, pair programming, ability to focus, and clarity of tasks. The average for each aspect was around 4.2 on a scale from 1 to 5.
> * Pair programming has been really helpful for the entire team. It has helped developers with learning and using NextJS.
> * Standup meetings have not been very helpful in the past week as we have to some extent reached the end of the project and there is not much for the group members to post.
> * Another important thing that we covered was the fact that we took a huge risk by deciding to use NextJS, however, Josh was very helpful in supporting the team with leanring and applying it.
> * Another thing that was mentioned as one of the factors that didn't go too well was NextJS but most people just struggled with it in the beginning and then got the hang of it.
> * Working with git and github was an issue for some memebrs but Tyler's how-to-use file was extremely helpful.
> * Some things that went well include the following: good communication, being done with the project early, a good skeleton of the project made by Josh, efficient pair programming, great functionality, and top-notch design.
