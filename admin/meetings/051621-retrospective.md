#### Decisions Made/Summary

> * Task clarity seemed to ranked lower than other aspects of our project. Reasoning probably includes the fact that we're still getting used to the new tools
> * People should partner up/text in general chat for the labs to help each other so we could focus more time on the project 
> * More meetings for developers should happen (most likely Wednesday's) once the coding begins
> * Making new channel on slack for deadlines of assignments to keep us organized and on task
> * Overall, people agree that our team has good communication
