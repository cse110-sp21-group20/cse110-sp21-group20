Technical Story: Basic decisions with regards to branding such as team name, color, and logo. 

## Context and Problem Statement

In order to reinforce the identity of our team, we need to pick a name, color, and logo representing our group and values.

## Decision Drivers <!-- optional -->

* The problem we are going to solve
* The effects of different colors on reducing stress
* The number of members in the group

## Considered Options

* Green For Color & a Journal Surrounded by 8 Stars for the Logo


## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: "Green for Color", because it was the only option proposed and in fact, it represents the group identity very well as green is usually considered a color for reducing stress and the journal surrounded by eight stars represents the eight members of the group.
