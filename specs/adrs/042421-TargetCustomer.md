Technical Story: Finalizing our target customers so that we can make design decisions based on their needs and preferences.

## Context and Problem Statement

Since we have discussed multiple target customers such as high school and college students, we need to finalize our decision as with our limited time for development and testing,
we cannot make a product that can benefit every potential user. In addition to finalizing our decision, the target customer needs to be from a niche market with specific needs so
we can address their pain points to the best of our ability with our limited resources available. 

## Decision Drivers <!-- optional -->

* Limited Time Available
* Some Developers Are Not Experienced in Web Dev and Some Useful Libraries in JavaScript
* Having Access to Potential Users for Interviews and Getting Their Feedback


## Considered Options

1)  General Users (Everyone) 
2) College Students
3) High School Students


## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: College students that go to colleges that are on the quarter system. The decision was made based on the following reasons:</br>
* We have access to potential users so we can easily get their feedback
* College students are under a tremendous amount of stress and our app can help them reduce their stress and maximize their efficiency
* Their needs are specific and we can implement features satisfying their needs in the limited time we have

### Positive Consequences <!-- optional -->

* The app can be modified with minimal effort in the future to be used by other students as well. For instance, college students that go to universities on the semester system can use it.

### Negative Consequences <!-- optional -->

* None


## Pros and Cons of the Options <!-- optional -->

### General Users

[Example: Mechanic | Description: Everyone who has access to the Internet] <!-- optional -->

* Bad, because every general user has different needs and by considering everyone's preferences, we might get into an endless loop without being able to finish the project.
* Bad, because we don't have access to all general users to get their feedback.
* Good, because everyone can use it and get organized.


### College Students

[Example: A UCSD Student| Description: Someone who is under a tremendous amount of pressure because of a busy schedule at school] <!-- optional -->

* Good, because we have access to this type of user and we can interview them. 
* Good, because the features they need can be implemented during the time and resources we have available.
* Good, because the program can be modified to satisfy the needs of other students like graduate students, high school students, and pretty much any other student.


### High School Students

[Example: A Student at a Fallbrook High School| Description: A student who struggles with prioritizing his tasks ] <!-- optional -->

* Bad, because we don't have access to this type of user.
