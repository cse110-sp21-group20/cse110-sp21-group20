# No Docs for CI

* Status: Accepted
* Deciders: Tyler, Tanay, <Josh, Vanessa, Rosey, Sam>
* Date: 05/25/2021

Technical Story: Whether or not to add JSDocs (or other documentation generators) in the project.

## Context and Problem Statement

JSDocs is a program that generates an HTML page for documentation from inline-comments in code files. Given the short term nature of the project, it may not be worth adding this as the devs might not even use it (instead preferring to read inline-comments).


## Considered Options

* Yes - Add JSDocs
* No - Don't add JSDocs


## Decision Outcome

The devs (represented by Tanay) decided that they will not use the documentation pages, so we will not continue forward with adding JSDocs to the project's CI pipeline.
